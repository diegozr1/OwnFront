### Speed up the start of a new web app

This is a frontend template to quick start every web project you make, this is an open source template to speed up your development and make a completely free and flexible frontend app.

It includes the best practices for frontend development of the modern web, a livereload webserver (no need to set a server), normalize, modernizr and jquery.

## How to use


-  **1.** Check if you already have installed **npm**, **bower**, and **gulp** 

	Via the command line do

	
	``` npm -v  && bower -v && gulp -v```

	If you get response with a number go to step 2, otherwise do the following
	

	- Go to the official website of [Nodejs](https://www.nodejs.org) to install it on your OS, npm comes with it

	- Install **Bower**

	```npm install --global bower```
	

	- Install **Gulp**
	
	```npm install --global gulp```
	
	**Note**, if you are getting permissions errors installing these plugins you may have to prepend those commands with sudo!


-  **2.** Download the zip file or clone the repo 

  	```git clone https://github.com/zdr00/OwnFront.git```
  	

- **3.** Go the folder *OwnFront* you just downloaded or cloned and 

 	Install the **bower** components

 	``` bower install ```

 	Install the **npm** components

	``` npm install ```

	Run **gulp**

	```gulp```
	
	You can make it in one line ``npm install && bower install && gulp```

	And go to your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
